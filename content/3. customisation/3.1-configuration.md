# Configuration and Content

This section covers how to configure and structure content in Cynthia Mini.

Configuration in Cynthia Mini is handled through the `cynthia-mini.toml` file. This file contains all the settings for your website. 

Content is stored in the content folder, each item being marked by a `.meta.json` file and most likely a `.md` file. The `.meta.json` files contain metadata about your content, while the `.md` files contain the actual content in Markdown format.

Learn more about configuration in the following sections:

1. [The Configuration File](/configuration/the-configuration-file) - Learn about the `cynthia-mini.toml` file structure
2. [Managing content](/configuration/content) - Controlling content on your site
3. [Theme list](/theme-list) - List of available Cynthia Mini themes

Configuration and content is all you need :)

# Cynthia Mini Theme Collection

> A Cynthia Mini theme comprises a carefully curated combination of predefined colour scheme and layout. We welcome contributions of additional themes through our [theme contribution guide](/adding-themes).

## Theme System Overview

The Cynthia Mini theme system employs a sophisticated approach, harmoniously combining colour schemes with layouts to deliver a cohesive visual experience.
The system intelligently selects an appropriate theme based upon your system's light or dark mode preferences.

To specify a theme in your `cynthia-mini.toml` file, edit one or both lines of:

```toml
theme = "autumn"
theme_dark = "oceanic"
```

If no theme is specified, the system will default to "autumn" for light mode and
"night" for dark mode.

### Theme Contribution Guide

This guide outlines the process of contributing a new theme to the Cynthia Mini ecosystem. If you intend to utilise an existing layout, you may proceed directly to the theme configuration step.

#### 1. Repository Preparation

Begin by creating a [fork](https://github.com/CynthiaWebsiteEngine/Mini/fork) of the official repository.

#### 2. Theme Configuration

Add your theme definition to the `themes.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "name": "your-theme-name",
  "prevalence": "dark",
  "fonts": ["Fira Sans", "Ubuntu", "Noto Sans"],
  "font-size": 15,
  "fonts-mono": ["Fira Mono", "Ubuntu Mono", "Noto Mono"],
  "font-size-mono": 14,
  "daisyUI": "synthwave",
  "layout": "your-layout-name"
}
```

For generating your own colour scheme instead of a daisyUI premixed colour scheme name, consider using <https://v4.daisyui.com/theme-generator/>. You can just replace the theme name with the colours object:

```json
{
  "name": "mythemename",
  "prevalence": "dark",
  "fonts": ["Fira Sans", "Ubuntu", "Noto Sans"],
  "font-size": 15,
  "fonts-mono": ["Fira Mono", "Ubuntu Mono", "Noto Mono"],
  "font-size-mono": 14,
  "daisyUI": {
    "mycolorschemename": {
      "primary": "#ff00ff",
      "secondary": "#ff00ff",
      "accent": "#00ffff",
      "neutral": "#ff00ff",
      "base-100": "#ff00ff",
      "info": "#0000ff",
      "success": "#00ff00",
      "warning": "#00ff00",
      "error": "#ff0000"
    }
  },
  "layout": "mylayout"
}
```

Please note that colour scheme names need to be unique, and that when you've defined a colour scheme like above, it can be referred to by name with other layouts.

#### 3. Layout Implementation

Begin by creating a new layout module. We recommend duplicating and renaming the `cindy_simple.gleam` file located at:

```gleam
cynthia_websites_mini_client/src/cynthia_websites_mini_client/pottery/molds/
```

This provides you with the cindy-simple template as a foundation.

Subsequently, establish references to your newly created layout by modifying:

```gleam
cynthia_websites_mini_client/src/cynthia_websites_mini_client/pottery/molds.gleam
```

Bind the `into()` function to your layout. The file contains detailed comments explaining the proper procedure for adding layout references.

You may then proceed to customise your layout module. The robust Gleam type system and Lustre's intuitive nature facilitate both template-based and programmatic approaches to layout development.

Note: CynthiaMini utilises [DaisyUI v4](https://v4.daisyui.com/components/) for its styling framework, which extends to layout styling capabilities.

#### 4. Submission Process

Submit your contribution through a Pull Request (PR). For guidance on creating a PR, please refer to the [GitHub documentation on Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Prior to submission, ensure all tests pass by executing:
```bash
bun run test
```

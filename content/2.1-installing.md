## Installing Cynthia Mini

There are two officially supported methods of installing Cynthia Mini.

### With Bun (recommended method)

If you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed, you can install Cynthia Mini by just running:

```sh
bun install -g @cynthiaweb/cynthiaweb-mini@latest
```
This installs latest release from NPM.

### With binary installer script

If you prefer not to use Bun, or can't use it to install, you can also use these binary install scripts:

#### For Linux and MacOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cynthiawebsiteengine.github.io/Mini-docs/assets/install.sh | bash
```

#### For Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://cynthiawebsiteengine.github.io/Mini-docs/assets/install.ps1 | iex"
```

This removes the need for Bun, but the cynthiaweb-mini CLI will be quite a big bigger in file size.
